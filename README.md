### Additional Notes:

- Ensure you're pasting this into a Markdown editor on GitHub or any text editor that supports Markdown syntax highlighting.
- Markdown syntax uses `#` for headers, `-` for lists, and ``` for code blocks, which helps maintain consistent formatting.
- Adjust any spacing or indentation as needed to match your preferred style.

By following these steps, you should be able to preserve the formatting, including font sizes, when creating or editing your README file on GitHub.
