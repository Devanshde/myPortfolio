It seems like you're encountering formatting issues when copying the README text. To ensure the font size remains consistent, you can follow these steps:

1. **Plain Text Editor**: Use a plain text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) to paste the README content.
2. **Markdown**: Ensure you're copying the text as plain Markdown format, without any rich text formatting.
3. **GitHub**: When you create or edit your README on GitHub, make sure to paste the text directly into the Markdown editor.

Hereâ€™s the README content with markdown syntax that should maintain consistent formatting:

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure you're pasting this into a Markdown editor on GitHub or any text editor that supports Markdown syntax highlighting.
- Markdown syntax uses `#` for headers, `-` for lists, and ``` for code blocks, which helps maintain consistent formatting.
- Adjust any spacing or indentation as needed to match your preferred style.

By following these steps, you should be able to preserve the formatting, including font sizes, when creating or editing your README file on GitHub.
